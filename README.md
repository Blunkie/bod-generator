# Bod Generator

This is a small tool that helps you template a new plugin using either my (bod-plugins) or illumineawake's + ChinBreakHandler combo.

## Instructions
* `git clone`
* `cd bod-generator` 
* `npm install`
* `node index`
* After running the command, go mark "java" folder as source and "resource" folder as Resource in intellij and build your plugins. Everything should work automagically.
